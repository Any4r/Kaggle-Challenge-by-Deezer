# Kaggle Challenge by Deezer

The task was to create a recommender system based on a Kaggle challenge proposed by Deezer, an online music streaming service. The competition was to predict whether the users of the (train) dataset listened to the first track which the “Flow” mode proposed to them, or not. Different approaches and potential recommender system methods were used to tackle this challenge.
